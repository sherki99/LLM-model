After graduating I transitioned to an office role at High Society, taking on the position of HR and Recruitment Manager. My passion for improving the wellbeing of others inspired me to complete a Mental Health First Aid course. I now use these skills to help with the wellbeing of our staff.\n",
      "Most memorable Event : Working at Tobacco Doc for the Rihanna Fenty X Puma collaboration. Tobacco Doc is a building like no other in London, and the event was very much the same. From the moment we walked in, we were quickly whisked away to change into forest green boiler suits and bright Fenty Pumas from the previous launch. The briefing provided clear guidance on our roles to ensure the event went as smoothly as possible. The team worked hard around the impressive backdrop of a waterfall of Fenty shoes and Rihanna herself! But the most memorable part of the event was the wonderful High Society Team.\n",
