# Gradio Basic Interface

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates how to build a basic **Gradio interface** for machine learning and interactive applications. Gradio makes it easy to create user-friendly GUIs for testing ML models, exploring datasets, or creating custom tools.

## Key Features
- **Input & Output Widgets**: Learn how to set up text, image, and numeric inputs.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Set up a live demo for testing functions or models.
- **Minimal Setup**: Create an interface without extensive coding experience.

## Why It’s Useful
- Quickly prototype ML models.
- Share tools with non-technical users via Gradio’s built-in hosting options.
- Test and visualize model behavior interactively.

## Prerequisites
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.7 or higher.
- Installed libraries:
  - `gradio`
  - `numpy` (or any additional dependencies specified in the notebook).

Install missing dependencies with:
```bash
pip install gradio numpy
